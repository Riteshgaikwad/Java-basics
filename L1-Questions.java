/*Question 1 : In a program, input 3 numbers : A, B and C. You have to output the average of
these 3 numbers.
(Hint : Average of N numbers is sum of those numbers divided by N)*/

//Solution:-
import java.util.Scanner; //its an header file for taking an input from the user
public class basics { 
    public static void main(String args[]){ 
       Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);  // declare scanner as an sc
       System.out.printf("Enter the value of a,b and c:");
       int a=sc.nextInt(); //taking all the input from the user
       int b=sc.nextInt();
       int c=sc.nextInt();
       int average=(a+b+c)/3; //calculating average og all  three numbers
       System.out.println("Average is:"+average); //printing the average as an output
       sc.close();
    }
    
}

/*
Question 2: In a program, input the side of a square. You have to output the area of the
square.
(Hint : area of a square is (side x side))
*/

//Soultion:-
import java.util.Scanner; //its an header file for taking an input from the user
public class basics { 
    public static void main(String args[]){ 
       Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);  // declare scanner as an sc
       System.out.printf("Enter the side of square:");
       int side=sc.nextInt(); // taking side as an input from user
       int area=side*side; // calculation the area of square
       System.out.println("The srea of square is:"+area); // printing the area as an output
       sc.close();
    }
    
}


/*
Question 3: Enter cost of 3 items from the user (using float data type) - a pencil, a pen and
an eraser. You have to output the total cost of the items back to the user as their bill.
(Add on : You can also try adding 18% gst tax to the items in the bill as an advanced problem)

/*
Question 4: 
will the following statement give any error in java
int $=24;
