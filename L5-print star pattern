***       -line 3
****      -line 4

1)check the lines ->line=4
2)outer loop ->run from 1 to no. of lines thus, 1 to 4
3)inner loop ->find the relation between line and stars ->thus, here line no. is equal to the no. of stars present in the line 
like line 1 have 1 star line 2 have 2 star so we will start inner loop from 1 to i

1)check the lines ->lines=4
2)outer loop ->run from 1 to no. of lines thus, 1 to 4
3)inner loop ->find the relation between line and stars ->thus, here we observe that star are equal to no. of lines and then they are decreasing
  according to the condition we get the logic that (n-line+1) where, n is number of line=4, line is the value of i which is from 1 to 4 
  and adding 1 because the loop will give ans as 4-1+1=4 similarly for next loop 4-3+1=3.... so on..
